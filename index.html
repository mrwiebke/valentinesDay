                 <li>These coupons are valid only with your participating Madelyn. Attempting to use them with any other party is NOT authorized.</li>
                 <li>These coupons have an expiration date of NEVER. Redeem in 10 yrs if you so please and they will still be accepted.</li>
                 <li>Please be aware that these coupons hold no cash value but TONS of sentimental value</li>
                 <li>Don't view these coupons as transactional. Everything on here are things that Madelyn would absolutely love to do for you and with you.</li>
                 <li>This code is not perfect but Madelyn (with the help of chat GPT) spent a lot of time writing code and tried her very best to create something you would appreciate.</li>
                 <li>You will not use the Reset button under any circumstances unless Madelyn has given explicit approval to do so.</li>
